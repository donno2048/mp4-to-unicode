This is a demo I used to create a release for this repo.

> Only works on Windows

Install _Pyinstaller_ using `pip install pyinstaller` (I assume you have already installed opencv-python and Pillow, if not, see the main README for details)

Then, run _build.py_ and the relese file will be in the dist folder.
